HOW TO RUN:

To compile, run `ant` in the main directory.
It will generate a progbots.jar which can be run with `java -jar
progbots.jar`.

HOW TO PROGRAM ROBOTS:

Use RobotAPI methods. To compile, compile using the progbots.jar as your
classpath. For instance: `javac YourRobot.java -classpath progbots.jar`
Then, package the class file in a jar with 'jar cf YourRobot.jar
YourRobot.class`

How to Use Program:

Load each robot by clicking the load robot button, then when done, click start
match.

Not yet implemented:

Damage detection. Game will run indefinitely because program does not yet have
the capacity implemented for robots to kill each other. Game will end when
"pause match" is pressed and program is exited.
